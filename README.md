# Binance Simple Crawler

This project includes 2 sub-projects (backend and frontend) due to the deployment method that I choose.

The backend is hosted on an EC2 instance, listening on port 80.
The frontend is hosted on github pages and can only work with `Insecure content` setting set to `Allow`.

## Deploy locally

make

## Terminate deployment
